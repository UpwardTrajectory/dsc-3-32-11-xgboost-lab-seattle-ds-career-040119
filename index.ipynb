    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll install the popular [XGBoost Library](http://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and explore how to use this popular boosting model to classify different types of wine using the [Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality) from the UCI Machine Learning Dataset Repository.  In this lesson, we'll install XGBoost on our machines, and then we'll use it make some classifications on the **_Wine Quality Dataset_**!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand the general difference between XGBoost and other ensemble algorithms such as AdaBoost\n",
    "* Install and use XGboost\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing XGBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "The XGBoost model is not currently included in scikit-learn, so we'll have to install it on our own.  To install XGBoost, you'll need to use conda. \n",
    "\n",
    "To install XGBoost, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open up a new terminal window.\n",
    "2. Activate your conda environment\n",
    "3. Run `conda install py-xgboost`. You must use conda to install this package--currently, it cannot be installed using `pip`. \n",
    "4. Once installation has completed, run the cell below to verify that everything worked. "

    "Great! We've now successfully made use of one of the most powerful Boosting models in data science for modeling.  We've also learned how to tune the model for better performance using the Grid Search methodology we learned previously.  XGBoost is a powerful modeling tool to have in your arsenal.  Don't be afraid to experiment with it when modeling."
